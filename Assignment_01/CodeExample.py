# Martin, Mitchell
# This is a screenshot of the 79 char ruler.

# Max Characters is 79
max_char = 79

# This will print out the number 79
print(max_char)

# This will print out 0 (as a string) x 79 times.
print('0' * max_char)

# your printout will not match the line because the Terminal font is not the
# same size as the VS code font. But if you copy it and paste it will fit!
